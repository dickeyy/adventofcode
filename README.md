The [./new-day.sh](./new-day.sh) script generates the boilerplate for a new day. To use it, run:

```bash
source ./new-day.sh <year> <day> # this will cd into the new folder

# or

./new-day.sh <year> <day> # this will not cd into the new folder
```

Personally, I have a alias for this `alias nd='source ./new-day.sh'`.
